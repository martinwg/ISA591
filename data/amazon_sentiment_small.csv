1,fdloose@bellsouth.net,"This is one of the weakest books I have read in quite some time. Predictable, calculated, unimaginative. I think M. Connelly is going downhill. Void Moon reads like a television show, is paced like a television show, and would probably make a good ""B"" television show. But, an exciting book it ain't. From the beginning you know who the little girl is and how she will come into play plot wise. I expected better. This is the last hardback I will buy from M. Connelly. And if the next Bosch story has as weak an ending as Angel's Flight, it will be the last Connelly book I buy, period. However, if you are in to mindless romps, you will probably enjoy Void Moon. If your tastes run a bit more discriminating, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Great book! It would make a terrific movie.,"This book brings small-town, high school football alive. I had a hard time putting it down. There is a touch of violence and some foul language so read it before you decide to let your children do so. For those adults who live in West Texas, especially those who have played sports or cheered on their favorite teams, you may find a likeness of yourselves in the book."
1,A bit too much...,Purchased because I enjoyed the Transporter movie series. This movie is very different and a lot more vulgar. I had to get rid of this movie because the language was just too much. It was a waste of money.
1,Save Your Money,This product is junk--difficult to use. You are working for the software instead of vice versa. Clumsy handling of data and poor screen presentation. Sorry I wasted my money.
1,Dorman mirror glass 51326,"This is my 2nd purchase of this item, the 1st has fallen of the frame and broke. They should make the glue strips stronger !"
2,Mediative/Yoga CD,"The music flows endlessly, but it's too bad that the same song is replayed on the CD instead of a different one. This CD should be priced lower."
2,"Excellent, but consider cheaper alternatives.","Body Glide works as advertized, and is the best anti-chafing product I've ever used. However, its huge price makes it a very poor value. I recommend trying simple antiperspirant deodorant (in stick-form) on your trouble areas first. If you find the deodorant provides adequate results, you will have saved yourself a ton of money per stick. If that doesn't work well enough for you, then I'd say Body Glide is definitely for you."
1,bad beck,this record is bad. mutations is great. how dare you rip off sarge? and call it a spoon song? well...I never...see you at fred 62 ;)
2,Invastion - the complete series,I watched this when it was on TV. Really enjoyed watching the DVDs over and over again
1,Awful,"My mother bought this ""sewing machine"" for me, thinking that she could save some money. I used it for one night, then I became so frustrated with it that I quit. It would frequently jam. It is now collecting dust on my bookshelf. It is incredibly hard to use and I would recommend it to no one!"
2,Inspiring to say the least,I saw her in concert and had to get her album. After listening to the entire album more times than I can count I got inspired to start writing songs and music again. Truly a talented person.
1,Rowenta DX1700 Just OK,"The old black & decker iron I was replacing was just as good. The Rowenta irons just fine, but is way too heavy and you have to add water way too often. Really a hassle to stop ironing and add more water."
2,A great cross-section,"""Prime Cuts"" is a best-of album so, you either like ST or you don't. Being a 20-year ST fan, I love having a cross-section of their material. (Personally, I was surprised the ""Controlled by Hatred"" didn't make the cut (no pun intended). If you're not a ST fan, then this is a great introduction. They never really made it big but they had some great material. Any interest in skater-thrash or metal? If so, ST is for you."
1,The worst vacuum I've ever owned,"I picked this up a local BJs, wish I had seen the reviews on Amazon first. There are no rollers on this vacuum, just two rows of bristles. I have two cats, one's a long hair that sheds pretty quick year round. The bristles catch the cat hair, get full and then just rolls it around on the floor. I have a low nap carpet, and it still can't remove anything except the most basic dirt. The conversion to a portable isn't all that wonderful either, the button to release the standard vacuum head is a bit tough to push in, and the hose doesn't do a much better job than the regular floor head did. Save your money, and buy an old vacuum at a thrift store before you buy this turkey."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"You know a script has gone south when every other word is the ""f"" word. The writers overloaded the ""f"" word using it as a noun, verb, adverb and I believe a conjunction. I know this is supposed to be a gritty film. But it was hard to tell the plot because the writing was so poor. We gave up after 15 minutes. This movie went directly to the trash."
1,and Why Not?,"I was curious to know his story, I didnt get much interesting views from him but I am still finding that his purpose is to shock people and blame everything on religion!"
2,Red Shopping Cart,"Easy to assemble, fits our cooler and boat supplies so that the run to the dock is faster and easier! Super large stable wheels take bumps well, rolls easily and is a joy to steer. Think this is for our Grandparents? Forget that and get one now!"
1,This was worthless had nothing to do with the Replacements!,I have bought other books in the series and I was hoping this would be a description surounding the making of Let It be by the Replacements. I was interested in the sounds and the songs and the methods for making this great record. What I got was the memoirs of a flavor of the month indie rock singer talking in way too much detail about mix tapes from middle school. I think choosing this kid to write about such a great band was a mistake.This book has very little to do with the Replacements.Collin is qualified to write about the Shins perhaps but not the Replacements.
2,AMAZING,"It's about time someone made a cd where every song is good and not just the first released. Avril Lavigne's new cd 'Let Go' is positively one of the best cd's I have ever bought. If it were a tape, I would've worn it out already, cuz I swear I play the cd about 15 times a day beginning to end. Every single song has a great message and makes you wanna get up and sing. It's a great cd, and the fact that Avril is just 17 (like myself) is even more amazing. Do I sound obsessed? That's cuz I am! Avril has loads of talent and I hope that everyone else gives her a chance as well. If you don't have the cd, go out and buy it, it won't be a waste of your money.~Avril's #1 fan: Holly~"
1,A Wannabe Oliver Stone Conspiracy Flick But More Absurd Than JFK,"The movie fails to advance its theory that Wayne Williams was not responsible for the murders. In fact, the producers are only interested in ignoring facts in favor of any scenario, no matter how improbable, that absolves Williams as the sole person responsible for the crimes. Since the arrest of Williams, the murders stopped. Why would this sci-fi flick want to address that fact? But those who get a kick out of mediocre acting and conspiracy woo should find it to their taste."
1,a disappointment,"I want to warn any pagans or those interested in paganism away from this book. I myself am a practicing pagan of many years. I know that Sybil Leek was a highly respected wiccan, and probably rightly so, but this book is a mess. The biggest chunk of it is spent dumping on contemporary pagans who just aren't doing it right (per Sybil), fairly uninteresting anecdotes, and surprisingly lame stuff like a whole chapter where she wrestles with her own homophobia. There's many better books than this one out there."
2,"Wonderful, comfortable, practical shoes!","Took my first pair of these with me on vacation & truly would not have needed any other shoes. (Terrain included streets, beaches, rocks) My feet stayed very comfortable, they are rugged, and very easy to keep clean. Pretty cute colors also. These are very much worth the price, had previously tried another brand but these are MUCH more comfortable."
1,Bogus Condition Rating,"This book was labeled as ""Used-Very Good."" The cover is littered with stickers, dirty and bent. Pages inside are creased, marked with sticky notes and pencil markings. I hardly consider this condition to be ""Very Good,"" ""Acceptable"" maybe. Without the stickers, sticky notes, and pencil markings I would rate it as ""Good."" Beware of the seller jenson_books_inc. I am disappointed in Amazon for allowing this seller to falsify the condition of their products."
1,not sure yet,"Gave it two stars for now as I am sure there is more than one way to skin this cat. Just dumping hot food in, it does not keep warm. I will try heating thermos as well. I do have a question about the instructions though. It says remove lid and STOPPER when heating, what STOPPER?"
1,Buyer Beware!! Bait & Switch,"Should have listened to the other reviewers, complaining about receiving the wrong item. I, too, was sent the Hohner brand. If that was what I wanted (and why would I?? It's awful!) I would have ordered (and paid a lot less for) that. Amazon, get your act together and stop these sellers from this 'bait & switch' tactic. VERY BAD FOR BUSINESS! Don't be fooled into thinking those who received the wrong one are in the minority - I am here telling you we are in the MAJORITY!"
2,Just as good as the others!!!!,"I could not wait for this book so when I read it I wanted to read it as slow as possible so I could savor it and for the first few days I managed too. But of course it didn't last long. I got hooked and didn't want to stop reading it. Although the Sam and Alyssa story wasn't my favorite. I thought the book as a whole was incredible. Suzanne Brockmann is an incredible writer. I would not have changed one thing about the story and now must wait for the next one, which I hope will be Max and Gina. Until then I must dream of Max instead of read about him."
1,you can not find the battery anywhere!,"I have this phone, battery is dead, and I searched everywhere, and could not find one with same model, this phone is out of date, not useful once the battery is gone!"
1,Not very French.,"English lyrics and melodies used in AMelie. This, good sirs, is no Amelie soundtrack!"
2,The Staircase,"I actually have not seen it yet as purchased it for neighbors, who have, and say it is very well done."
2,Incredibly beautiful!,"Desiderata, Words for Life by Max Ehrmann with photographs by Marc Tauss is gorgeous. It is filled with thought provoking words and dreamy, lush photos. Desiderata is beautifully designed with lovely, richly toned photos and simple, elegant typography. Desiderata offers quite a mental escape for one during rough times. It's a perfect book for many different occasions: graduations, birthdays, promotions, etc. I highly recommend it for people of all ages."
1,My two cents,"""These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires.""-George Lucas in a speech to Congress in 1988 about Preserving Works of Art."
1,Road to Mediocrity,"This movie is nothing but a sad ""Godfather"" want to be. The story has more holes than can be imagined. Characters are sadly underdeveloped and make utterly no sense. Tom Hanks is the greatest over actor in the history of cinema and his constant yelling contends with that of the annoying Gene Hackman. Paul Newman gives an interesting performance but is way under used, as is Jude Law. Law's character is so underdeveloped that he is cartoonish at best. The villian in this movie being the son of a crime boss (Newman)is unjustified in everything he does. At no time does the audience care about these people the way they do in movies such as ""the Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas."" The power in crime dramas has always come from that portrait of the duality of man but here all we are given are black and white charicatures. This movie is destined to be lost in the drift of the most forgettable movies in history. Don't waste your time!!!"
1,crap,"This unit worked well for a month or so then started stopping in the middle of a song. Sometimes it will start again - other times it will not play no matter what you do. The radio is just about useless as the tuning is so tight it is hard to line up a station. I have to say the alarm worked well as long as you put it on buzzer and not cd. Overall, spend a few extra bucks and get a better unit."
1,"Well, it was pretty bad.","I haven't read something this poorly written since Christian Jacq's 'Ramses - Son of Light'. I attributed the thin, 2-dimensional prose to an inept translation from French to English. Could this be the same reason? It is quite bad."
2,One good book.,This was a fabulious book about how putting God first in your life can bring you true love here on the earth. Go with your heart but make sure it's God approved. Awesome book would recommend a definite read!
2,Science and what Mendel's Dwarf really thinks,"If you love biologoy/genetics you'll enjoy the book for that alone but it also contains the story of an unusual relationship and an intelligent perspective on the world from this Dwarf's perspective. The dry wit isn't the haha variety but cutting and dark. Don't expect a good cry, just the opposite. There's a lot to be bitter about and it's expressed with no apologies. Good story, great education, good ending."
1,Disappointing and tired.,"I anticipated this book would have useful and immediately applicable elements to do what the title suggests, incorrect. The book is written in a ""hey were all cool, play using the fingers you want...""kind of language which in no way makes the long tracts on the history of sound etc any less boring. There are supposed to be casettes ( which in 1984 when the book was first published is reasonable I suppose) to use in conjunction with the book which surely could have been updated to be put on a CD for inclusion with the book rather than subsequent purchase ( does anyone still have cassette players??). In all, this book is tired and needs complete revising and updating. Your money is better spent elsewhere, a new set of strings for instance."
2,Great monitor - for everything except games.,"I have had this monitor for six months now and have found itvery good (I even watch TV on it (suggest getting the add on box from viewsonic for this, I tried a tv card and resonse time was too slow, picture would pause for a second about once a minute since it couldn't display in native resolution, my card only supported 800x600 resolution for tv signal).The response time may be a bit too slow for games that run in lower resolutions (monitor native is 1280x1040). Stand adjustment is very simple and hookup and setup are also. This one is agood value even though prices for LCD's have gone up a bit lately. Have used this monitor with win98 and XPhome, driver for XP is superior. For a lightweight LCD this model is very sturdy and has clear/easy on screen adjustment features."
1,"Best of Hogan, Not Nitro","I will keep this straight forward and to the point. The only positive aspect of this video is it does have old footage of WCW Nitro. You can not really see this stuff anymore unless you recorded it yourself back in the day. However, this whole video is about Hogan. Hulkster or Hollywood, every match has Hogan, so really this is not the best of Nitro, since Hogan slowed matches down anyway. Hogan is the man, but not right in this Nitro collection. The tape covers Hogan from 94 to early 99. If you like the Hulk then get this, but again, not even close to being a best of Nitro video. None of the matches shown were very well done, even if it was a championship match. I wish it was better, but it is not a good example of the great matches from Nitro. **"
2,Perfect for the Nightstand,"I purchased this set as refills for my Homedics AromaSpa Aromatherapy Diffuser. The scents are very soft and pleasant, not overbearing at all. Love the set -- it's extremely easy to remove/replace in the diffuser with no mess involved. Packed in small plastic jars, they keep very well over a long period of time.The perfect spot I've found to use my diffuser is on my nightstand where you can fully appreciate the fragrance it emits. If you're looking to provide aromatherapy for a larger room or area, you may consider another type of product as this one works well for smaller areas and the fragrance does not travel very far."
1,It has not come yet....,"It must be lost in the mail, we are still waiting but I am asured it has been reordered and will come by Friday...talk to me then."
2,"An excellent book, thought provoking, eye opening.","Sitchin, once again, provides us with a truly insightful look into our past. For anyone with a desire to find out what really lies in our past and how it may one day affect our future...this book is a must!I could not put it down...each chapter left me wanting more. If you are a student of religion, Sitchin's insights helps to fill in the blanks. A wonder companion to the Bible."
2,A Haunted House movie that dares to be DIFFERENT!,"It starts off almost normal, people talking around a campfire and theyt tell scary stories about the old Dread Mansion, a place that one of them has just bought. They all eventually get trapped inside in trypical HH fashion and things move along brisk at this point. By the middle, things really take some odd turns and the film kicks into overdrive. Gore flies, the camera zooms and twists and the story goes into some new and exciting places. To tell more would be to give too much away. Things heat up in this one and the pacing increases to a really great finish that had me on the edge of my seat. Great care seems to have been taken on the look of the film because I was really impressed with the atmosphere and the lighting. Sure, some of the acting is poor in spots, but othet acting is incredible (the guy in the wheelchair!) and the effects are very realistic and sick. I give it a 4 and a half. Impressive, entertaining and a lot of fun."
2,music review,"Avril Lavigne is like my all time favorite singer. i like her style. one of the best songs on the CD was ""innocence."" One of the best CD's i own!"
1,Holes wide enough to drive a Mac Truck through,"I was surprised how weak this book was. It had a great start but fizzled soon there after. It seemed as if the author was trying to find ways to lenthen the story. There were so many holes. I wondered why the area where Kate emerged from her ordeal was not immediately and thoroghly searched. They eventually get to it late in the book. Also, when ""The Gentleman"" made his get away, why didn't the FBI just shoot the tires of his car? The author skirts around the identity of the villian so much that by the time he is reveal its like, ""DUH!"""
2,Take it on the plane,"As others have noted, this isn't a ""history"" per se, and shouldn't be taken as such. It's fast-paced, informed journalism that keeps its focus throughout and, in my opinion, offers a number of excellent critiques and observations of the current social climate in China. Reading it on the train from Beijing to Xi'an, I found myself constantly nodding along as I discovered different ways of making sense of what I was seeing there."
2,Not just for kids,"A funny, witty book. Kids liked it a lot, and I enjoyed reading it even though I'm not a kid any more. Nice pictures too. Highly Recommended."
2,Finally a mathematical origami book that I can follow!,"I have a personal and professional interest in mathematical origami. However, until reading this book, I had trouble finding math origami directions that are easy to follow. If you want to build geometric models, this book will not disappoint you. The directions are clear, and the illustrations help, too. But first go to AIMS website to compare the price of this book straight from the publisher."
1,bad product,This product worked less than 3 months with very light usage. I would not purchase again.
2,like a kid again,I love this Jem and the Holograms. I feel like a kid again and i received it early too. Love jem!!
1,Not Great,"I'm an editor and a huge Police fan. I bought this to prove to somebody how awesome a band the were. Fail! The person spent the entire time scrutinizing the editing which is maybe the worst, large name band, concert video ever. Now to be fair I feel I should say that the people who have given this four and five stars apperently did not have the same experience as I did. Hey, perspective is everything, but if you buy it and hate it you can't say you weren't warned."
1,Not very good.,"I love Michael Crawford's version of Baby Mine, but did not enjoy any of the other songs. I don't know if he is unable to sing like he he used to or what, but he sounds very subdued throughout the whole album."
2,"too much, not enough...","A big ""WOW!"" to Michael Gross for being able to gather and present information on such a vast and secretive industry, the modeling business. The book was huge but I enjoyed every single page and appreciated the inclusion of photographs. The only complaint I have is that the mentions of Brooke Shields and Cindy Crawford were way too small. When I was an impressionable teen back in the 90's Cindy was THE SUPER-SUPERMODEL and when i was reeeeeally little it was all about Brooke (what i'm trying to say is I was actually alive at the time so I know this as first hand knowledge) so I was surprised that they barely got any attention. But really the book was FULL of stories, it was really a fun read! I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone who loves the modeling/fashion world and especially to those girls who want to be models."
1,No 108MBps - No support,"It looks like there have been others with the same issues I have had. 108MBps does not work and Netgear's support is beyond unhelpful. I replaced another Netgear router for this one and two wireless G adapters so I could get faster speeds. Hundreds of dollars later, I have what I started out with as far as performance goes. Netgear has already replaced this once after a firmware update screwed up the first router. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Avoid this Gel; Use Clear Wax if you want secure bond,I have used clear Museum Wax and the neutral putty for years. This was the first time I ordered the gel. What a mistake!! I am educated enough to read and follow the simple directions and not one glass would adhere to any glass shelf. Talk about a dissapointment and this useless product is much more expensive. I would not recommend this product to any one.
2,its very good,The Selmers Cork Grease is very good !!! it good if your going to band it lasts very long and it not so expensive either
1,Died after one day,"My Garmin Forerunner lasted one day before it stopped working. Now I have to go to the post office and pay to have it shipped back to Garmin, and wait to have them either repair or replace it. Next time I need to purchase an electronics item I'll go to a regular store where I can easily and immediately exchange a defective unit."
1,"You're throwin' away a fortune here, don't be a fool","The only reason a fan is tempted to buy these dvds in the first place is for the ""bonus"" discs, so the original theatrical versions are the ones to which I am referring. I made a big mistake yesterday when I dropped sixty plus on what I suspected might be trash. Video quality is horrible. Gritty and grainy with horizontal lines in places, vertical in others. Don't be like me and jump at the chance to get these. Let them rot on the shelves. I was a believer that these couldn't possibly be as bad as everyone said. Now I must admit that I was wrong. I have no complaints about the sound, but the picture made me wake up with a headache which still lingers even as I write this. Save your hard-earned cash and join the crusade to get these done right."
1,Learn elsewhere,"A disorganized muddle of clinical correlations, chemical mechanisms, and pathways, the text attempts to destroy an otherwise beautiful topic. It is difficult to extract the main pts and organize the information into a coherent fashion. But fortunately there are other texts, and a map showing how all the pathways converge and a table w/enzymes organized by mechanism w/cofactor, rxn info will be golden. With books like Lippincott's Reviews and Voet&Voet, youll be biochemistry's biggest fan in no time."
2,A hardy surge protector,"Without a doubt, this is the best surge protector I have. I own 5. It has the rating to protect my equipment, ant the insurance package to pay for my protected gear if the unthinkable happens. I like the phone also being protected. Lightning and power surges do odd things and this is my ""firewall"" against the stray voltage surge. I really like the rotating outlets, never a problem with a plug-in charger. Just rotate it out of the way. As you guessed, I recommend it."
1,Really bummed!,"I had this player for a couple of months (4) when the headphone jack went out on me. Intel gladly returned it. One year later, the exact same thing happened. Even tho the warranty had expired, I felt this was a major ""flaw"" and they should help me out. I called customer support and because they no longer make these, there is no support. I LOVED the thing while it worked..."
2,WOW,"I didn't used to like music, let alone Metallica. But then a friend of mine made me listen to Enter Sandman, and I went out a bought as many Metallica CDs as I could buy the next day! I was hooked!"
2,The best wedding CD we used for our wedding!,"This was an amazing CD, atually a double CD. It had 53 total tracks, and all the music we needed. Before we found it, we had purchased about 7 different wedding CDs trying to find the perfect songs. The other CDs had mostly poor recordings and very limited selection and we were really discouraged. Then we heard about this CD and WOW! The recordings were all crisp, clear, wonderfully orchestrated and perfect for our intimate wedding!It was amazing to us that one CD could be so different from all the others in the genere.Our recommendation, forget about all the other CDs, you only need one. It has more music than the others combined, and sounds fantastic. We may be a little biased, after all we used it for all our ceremony music - but it's still true - This CD is by far the best!"
1,Don't be fooled,"I gave this one 1 star, not because of it's quality, but this misleaded me. I thought it was a block big enough, ja! ja! When I received it, my surprise!: this block in size(it's length) was not bigger than my thumb. Just to give you an idea, it's length is about the same length as a Zippo lighter.For $1.00, this product is OK, but not for what is selling for."
1,WHAT was THAT?!?!?,"Mix ""Men in Black"" with ""The X Files"" and ""Terminator"", add some really badly-translated subtitles and dubbed English dialogue, and you have a flick that doesn't even need the 'bots of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to make it funny. Although the date given for this film is 1993, [one website] tags it as a 2002 film. And, as the reviewer there notes, this film is ""deep hurting."" This one is strictly for (unintentional) laughs."
2,Es increible,Este video del concierto en Wembley es lo mejor que hay son maravillosas las 4 y su musicaa y si quieren ver a Emma en accion sola aqui es una buena opcion para verla y tambien disfrutar de la Voz de Melanie C y del vestuario de Melanie G y disfrutar todo y ver a victoria su esfuero que hace a un con su embarazo es lo mejor.
2,Performs as expected,"Well made, not flimsy.21in diameter dish is not available in the stores. Checked them all.Only online. -- --"
2,Deflector for 2006 Honda Element,"Got this hood deflector for my 2006 Honda Element. Fits well. Giving it a 4-Star rating only because installation was a little tricky: the deflector installs between the hood and the weather-strip. The holes in the deflector line up with the existing holes under the hood so no drilling is needed, but the two middle ""tabs"" of the deflector are a bit wide, so you need to remove two snaps that hold the weather-strip in order to accommodate the deflector. That being said, I haven't noticed any trouble with the weather-strip being loose. Also, with the added thickness of the deflector, closing the hood requires it to be dropped from a higher height: don't worry, it'll be loud, but the hood will be just fine."
1,delivery error,I placed an order on the 4th of February. Only yesterday it was delivered. An error occurred when the address was given to UPS services. I noticed this error directly on the tracking message from UPS. I sent several emails to the costumer service indicating this error and trying to solve the problem as soon as possible. They took at least 3 days to answers my emails and only yesterday (27th February) the order was delivered.
2,Canine Epilepsy,"This is a very informative book, the only one on the subject I have been able to find. The initial section on diet seemed over long and complicated but the rest of the book I found very helpful. It is distressing to see your dog have a seizure but I found the content encouraging and felt comforted that the condition can be managed without resort to drugs. Some of the tips I have started to use."
2,Your best lens is often your feet,"Kerry Drager covers a range of topics, that include lenses, lighting, Depth of Field, and composition, to name a few.Throughout each topic he dispenses practical advice such as remembering to bring a snack or a plastic tarp and padding to protect your clothing and save your knees.Written in a clear, simple, yet engaging manner, this book covers a broad range of material for scenic photography enthusiasts.Well illustrated, this book provides ample examples to have the reader clamoring to run out with their camera and put some good advice to immediate use."
2,Hilarious,"This movie is awesome, a definite most have in any movie collection. This is Eddie Murphy at his finest, classic!!!"
1,"Ok, but didn't quite cut it.","I liked the physical design, but was unable to get anything resembling a strong or clear signal in my car. I tried a few different things, but have given up. I think it might have worked OK if I there were not any other competing radio stations in the area."
1,Graphic,"Zoo Tycoon 1 is the best game ever. This game is expensive, requires a fancy graphics card (Though i seem to be the only one in the world without one) and a lot of memory. I could not get it to open.I haven't got a clue as to how fun this game is. Do not buy this game unless you are rich enough to buy a graphics card that costs that much."
2,Terrific printer,"I took a picture of roses with my Canon G3, printed on Canon photo paper with the i850, and the image quality far surpassed my expectations. To the naked eye, it looks like it is a photo lab print, not an inkjet print. The separate ink tanks are a more economical way to go than the all-in-one cartridges. Great fast printer for a great price, highly recommended."
2,McDowell & Hostetler have made a winner!,"Even though this book is a few years old now (I read it about 5 yrs ago), what McDowell and Hostetler have said in this book still stands true. Looking back over the last 60 years or so, if you really want to know what went wrong with society, this is the book to read."
1,High School Textbook - Not Great,"The newer edition (presumably revised, not just with new chapters) with Samuel Bryant might be better than the one I own, but my 1958 edition of the Rise of the American Nation is not one of my favorites. This was the textbook I had to read in 1972 as a High School senior in South Boston. I think it is overly patriotic, and I am a conservative. My edition only has Todd and Curti as authors. I have read a lot of history textbooks and this is way below average. Its chief value is instructing the reader on how America's students were being instructed back in the day."
2,Attention Regency romance fans,"Take notice, Georgette Heyer fans. This is perfect for a rainy day read. From the opening clatter of carriage wheels over cobblestones and the bawling news of Napoleon's defeat, we are whisked into a clever mystery embellished with a wealth of period detail. The heroine is elegant, the hero dashing, and they spar back and forth admirably. So why isn't Bride of Newgate better known among Regency romance fans? and why is it out of print?"
2,Poignant storytelling,"As a few reviewers have noted, the book gains momentum with each chapter. Did Fowler plan that? or was it more a matter of the flow of the story grabbing her at about page 100? One wonders.Stay with this book. It is a gem of a story, and it will prompt you to remember that we are meant to live passionately; we are meant to surrender to ourselves and our yearnings; and that we are meant to care about and for others.The book gives us an experience that teems with life -- of the sea, of the island, of the forgotten coast along the Big Bend (Carrabelle, Eastpoint, Appalachicola), where most still struggle to make ends meet by fishing for oysters and shrimp.You will fall in love with all of the characters, and you will fall in love with the setting. This is fine writing and even finer storytelling. Fowler is a treat."
1,Warning: This tea COULD make you very sick,"This Yin/Yang tea is designed to clear your body of toxins. You take Yang in the morning before 1PM and Yin after 1PM, one or more cups as long as they are balanced. Funny, but the ingredients are the same in both teas. You also get a very small amount of tea for the price. But don't worry, you won't drink it all. Designed to clear your body of toxins, this tea made me VERY sick ... excessive sweating and nausea, followed by severe vomiting and diarrhea. It's one thing to clear out your toxins, but this clears nutrients too.I may be more sensitive than others since I have a digestive inflammatory condition, but you've been warned.They claim weight loss and I believe that because if you can't keep food down you'll definitely lose weight.There are other teas, such as Traditions Of Tao Inner Cleanse that work well and do not cause illness. Use this tea only if you are desperate and like nausea and throwing up."
2,Very Good,Very good CD! A.C.Sharp is a promising new and upcoming Artist in the New Age Genre! I hope he expands his talent into Meditative & Ambiant Music!
1,boring and dragged out,"I usually read a historical romance novel in 2 days. Long, boring and drawn out!!!!! This is the first of Medeiros books for me and the last!!!!"
1,Poor Quality Control,The first one they sent leaked. J&R kindly took that one back. The second one made an unholy noise during the wash and rinse cycles and required a service call. Repair guy said motor was installed too low. Hoping to start getting some use out of it now.
2,Awesome...,This book was a random pickup for me. But I actually enjoyed it more than I thought! Ian was a mess!
1,Flimsy design,Beware that the playing board in this set is flimsy cardboard. Way too easy for marbles to fall out. Not recommended.
1,Not worth it.,After spending hours trying to get it to work I've learn that people are having trouble with these more frequently then not. If you're on the fence about this just don't do it. If you try to go for it good luck to you.
1,not very good quality,"this product hasn't last very well at all. i've had it for under a year and the front plastic plate fell off, the remote control stopped working and the alarm icon randomly stops showing up on the front from time to time. also sometimes even when my alarm isn't set it still goes off. and sometimes when my alarm is set it doesn't go off! very frustrating, i will not be buying this product again!"
2,*yellowcard RULES*,"First of all I would like to say that YC is an awesome band who gives great live shows! They play great punk music, with a twist..they also have a violin player. Their music is great, the singer is great. This is a great CD. If you buy it, you wont be disappointed. Because YC rocks, and they put their heart in to everything they do."
1,Total Hate for a great President,If you Hate Ronald Reagan you will love this book. If you live in the real world and know how much our country improved under his presidency you will find this book distastful. My wife purchased this book to read about Reagon because she is from another country and wanted to learn about American History.I would rate this book as total crap.
2,Love,Jennifer Weiner is my number one favorite author. I have read all of her books and enjoy reading them. Its hard to put one of her books down once you get started.
1,gAH,"I have to say this book is not a keeper, and really not worth the buy. It was boring and left to many unknown elements to the story, like that little rabbit kid in the begining. I will definantly not buy any further issuses because of the let down this was."
2,High Sierra Grandma,"We've tried many other squeegee brands and find this one works the best for the shower. The handle is comfortable and it really gets the glass door and stone tiles dry. Doesn't leave any marks behind. Hope OXO keeps making these, another great product of theirs."
2,Joan Crawford In The Wild West,"Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCaimbridge play rival touugh ladies in this western allegory about feminism, the red scare, and mob rule. Crawford shows why she was a major star--her authority is unquestioned. McCaimbride is amazing."
1,Didn't do a thing for me...,"I received item on time. I've been taking for weeks, but have noticed no change in energy level. Quite disappointed."
2,My first Rita Estrada book & it was a joy,"I have to say, I first bought this book for the ever-so-hunkyStefan Adreas Schwarze on the cover, but it turned out to be avery good book. I never did figure out, though, who was suppossedto be the wicked one? Certainly not Sarah, and I didn't even thinkof Ben as being the one. Perhaps it was Fairy/Merci? Probably not, she was so sweet, with wisdom beyond her years. I actuallydidn't see any villans in the book, truth be told. As for the waythe book ended, I felt it was a bit abrupt, because we don't actually get to hear Sarah tell Ben her secret, and because I wanted an actual wedding ceremony & an epilogue of their life withkids & a ranch years later. Also, the book was a bit of a slowstarter, the angst, if you could call it that, didn't start until sometime after the first 50 pages. All in all, a very good read."
1,An extremely hostile collection of essays.,"The book is a strange collection of essays, mostly written by people extremely hostile to their subject. There's not even a common thread in the book. The claim of the editor that this collection could be considered a 'tribute' to Bookchin is absurd."
2,Yes We Can Can: The Best of the Blue Thumb Recordings of the Pointer Sisters,I have been looking for several of the selections which are featured on this CD. I was happy to find them in one CD. The item arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.
1,Won't make your hair grow,"So I purchased this because so many reviews were giving it 5 stars. Unfortunately I didn't read most of the reviews and little was actually said about hair growth. People were giving it 5 stars based on the fact their hair was so much silkier, and healthy. This product markets the fact that it makes your hair grow, and so I am basing my review on that claim with 1 star, because it does not.Almost any new shampoo/conditioner you buy is going to make your hair feel good, (unless it's really cheap stuff )because it always happens when you switch products. Also a clarifying shampoo will do this as well, removing residue from the last product."
2,Brilliant,A little difficult to set your step accurately but no more so than for any other pedometer. Gives lots of information and inspires to walk further.
1,Too difficult to use,I bought this for my 7 year old son. He isn't actually able to use it and neither am I. This may be because neither of us have good eyesight and it doesn't seem to work well with glasses.
